1. Understand the code.
2. Run the prediction over Solar data & find the best parameters for ARMA for
- Our target is to predict long term -> should we forecast daily or hourly?
- What are the input data?
- How long we need to look back the past data (autoaggressive)? How long for averaging (moving average)?

"Solar Generation Prediction using the ARMA Model in a Laboratory-level Micro-grid"
or other papers if available
3. Download the data of solar generation & wind generation.
